2.  **Extract**: Extract the downloaded archive to a directory (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
3.  **Add to PATH**: Add the `bin` directory inside your FFmpeg installation folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your system's PATH environment variable. You can search for "Environment Variables" in Windows, then edit the "Path" variable under "System variables".
4.  **Verify**: Open a new command prompt and type `ffmpeg -version`. If installed correctly, you should see FFmpeg version information.

### macOS

1.  **Homebrew**: The easiest way to install FFmpeg on macOS is using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew, install it by following instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).
2.  **Install**: Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```
3.  **Verify**: Run `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal to confirm the installation.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

    ```
2.  **Install**: Install FFmpeg using apt:
